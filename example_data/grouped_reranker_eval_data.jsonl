Data on the efficacy and safety of adjuvant alectinib as compared with chemotherapy in patients with resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC are lacking.\n### Methods\nWe conducted a global, phase 3, open-label, randomized trial in which patients with completely resected,*ALK*-positive NSCLC of stage IB (tumors ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA (as classified according to the seventh edition of the*Cancer Staging Manual*of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for International Cancer Control) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral alectinib (600 mg twice daily) for 24 months or intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy in four 21-day cycles. The primary end point was disease-free survival, tested hierarchically among patients with stage II or IIIA disease and then in the intention-to-treat population. Other end points included central nervous system (CNS) disease–free survival, overall survival, and safety. \nDownload a PDF of the[Research Summary]().\n### Results\nIn total, 257 patients were randomly assigned to receive alectinib (130 patients) or chemotherapy (127 patients). The percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 2 years was 93.8% in the alectinib group and 63.0% in the chemotherapy group among patients with stage II or IIIA disease (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 0.45; P<0.001) and 93.6% and 63.7%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.43; P<0.001). Alectinib was associated with a clinically meaningful benefit with respect to CNS disease–free survival as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for CNS disease recurrence or death, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.58). Data for overall survival were immature. No unexpected safety findings were observed.\n### Conclusions\nAmong patients with resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC of stage IB, II, or IIIA, adjuvant alectinib significantly improved disease-free survival as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy.

In the phase 3 ADAURA trial, adjuvant osimertinib showed a significant benefit with respect to disease-free survival as compared with placebo among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (*EGFR*) mutation–positive NSCLC of stage IB, II, or IIIA.[7]()Recent data indicate that this large disease-free survival benefit can translate into an overall survival benefit.[29]() \nAlectinib is a potent oral ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has shown high levels of efficacy across three phase 3 trials involving patients with advanced*ALK*-positive NSCLC.[30-32]()In the global phase 3 ALEX trial, patients with previously untreated advanced*ALK*-positive NSCLC who received alectinib had significantly longer progression-free survival than those who received crizotinib,[31]()with improved 5-year overall survival.[33]()Alectinib has also shown substantial activity in patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease.[15,34,35]()Long-term treatment with alectinib has a safety profile that reflects mainly low-grade adverse events.[36]()On the basis of these results, alectinib is a preferred first-line treatment in patients with advanced*ALK*-positive NSCLC.[2,4]()These data in advanced NSCLC support investigation of alectinib in resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC to determine whether it can reduce the risk of disease recurrence, improve outcomes after surgery, and reduce the incidence of recurrence in the CNS. \nWe report results from the primary analysis of the randomized, open-label, phase 3 ALINA trial, which is investigating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant alectinib as compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC. Follow-up is ongoing.\n## Methods\n\n### Trial Patients\nEligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had completely resected, histologically confirmed stage IB (tumors ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC (as classified according to the seventh edition of the*Cancer Staging Manual*of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for International Cancer Control) and documented*ALK*-positive disease by a Food and Drug Administration–approved or European Conformity (CE)–marked test, either locally or centrally performed. Other criteria included eligibility for platinum-based chemotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale in which higher scores reflect greater disability), and no previous systemic anticancer therapy. Full eligibility criteria are detailed in the trial[protocol](), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n### Trial Design and Treatment\nALINA is a global, phase 3, open-label, randomized trial (Fig. S1 in the[Supplementary Appendix](), available at NEJM.org). Screening and randomization occurred 4 to 12 weeks after patients had undergone complete surgical resection (lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy). Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral alectinib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily or intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy in four 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified according to disease stage (IB [≥4 cm] vs. II vs. IIIA) and race (Asian vs. non-Asian). Treatment with alectinib was given for 24 months or until the occurrence of disease recurrence, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. Chemotherapy options were cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1 of each cycle, plus vinorelbine at a dose of 25 mg per square meter (on days 1 and 8), gemcitabine at a dose of 1250 mg per square meter (on days 1 and 8), or pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg per square meter (on day 1), according to local prescribing information. In the event of cisplatin intolerance, carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg per milliliter per minute was administered. A formal crossover design was not built into this trial. Subsequent treatment after disease recurrence was entirely at the discretion of the investigators.\n### Trial Oversight\nThe trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. An independent data monitoring committee evaluated data regularly during the trial. The protocol and subsequent amendments were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each site. All the patients provided written informed consent. \nF. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech sponsored the trial, provided the trial drugs, and collaborated with the academic authors on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. All the authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Medical writing assistance, under the direction of the authors, was funded by F. Hoffmann–La Roche.\n### End Points and Assessments\nThe primary end point was disease-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented recurrence of disease or new primary NSCLC as determined by the investigator or to death from any cause. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. Exploratory end points included CNS disease–free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented recurrence of disease in the CNS or death from any cause. \nDisease assessments were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks for the first 2 years, every 24 weeks for years 3 through 5, and then annually until the occurrence of disease recurrence, death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or trial termination by the sponsor, whichever occurred first. All disease assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (or computed tomography of the brain if MRI was unavailable). The adverse-event reporting period lasted until 28 days after the last alectinib dose or chemotherapy cycle.\n### Statistical Analysis\nEfficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all the patients who underwent randomization, and in the subgroup of patients with stage II or IIIA NSCLC. The safety-evaluable population was defined as all the patients who underwent randomization and received any amount of trial drug. \nKaplan–Meier methods were used to estimate median disease-free survival and 2- and 3-year disease-free survival. Brookmeyer–Crowley methods and Greenwood’s formula were used to construct 95% confidence intervals for medians and landmark rates, respectively. A stratified log-rank test was used to compare disease-free survival between treatment groups. To control the overall level of significance at a two-sided error rate of 0.05, disease-free survival was tested with the use of a prespecified hierarchical approach, first among patients with stage II or IIIA disease and then in the intention-to-treat population. Hazard ratios among patients with stage II or IIIA disease were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox regression model with race (Asian vs. non-Asian) as a stratification factor. For the intention-to-treat population, disease stage (IB [≥4 cm] vs. II vs. IIIA) was also a stratification factor. \nThe trial was designed to show superiority of alectinib as compared with chemotherapy with respect to disease-free survival, with 80% power to detect a target hazard ratio of 0.55 among patients with stage II or IIIA disease and 0.58 in the intention-to-treat population. This preplanned interim analysis was conducted when 67% of events (59 events) were observed among patients with stage II or IIIA disease. \nHere we report the results of the preplanned interim analysis, conducted by an independent data monitoring committee. Additional statistical methods are provided in the[Supplementary Appendix](), and the statistical analysis plan is available with the protocol at NEJM.org.\n## Results\n\n### Patients and Treatment\nIn total, 257 patients were enrolled from August 2018 through December 2021 at 113 sites across 26 countries: 130 patients received alectinib and 127 patients received chemotherapy (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The median time from surgery to randomization was 1.7 months. At the data-cutoff date (June 26, 2023), 20.3% of the patients in the alectinib group were receiving treatment. \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally well balanced between the treatment groups ([Table 1]()) and were broadly similar to the available demographic data in patients with*ALK*-positive NSCLC (Table S2); however, Black patients were underrepresented in the trial population. As compared with the chemotherapy group, the alectinib group had a higher percentage of female patients (57.7% vs. 46.5%) and patients who had never smoked (64.6% vs. 55.1%). No patients in the trial received neoadjuvant radiotherapy or postoperative radiotherapy. \nTable 1 \n\n\n|Characteristic |Alectinib(N=130) |Chemotherapy(N=127) |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n|Age | | |\n|Median — yr |54 |57 |\n|Distribution — no.

At the data-cutoff date, approximately 18 months had passed since the last patient had undergone randomization. \nA total of 231 patients had stage II or IIIA disease: 116 in the alectinib group and 115 in the chemotherapy group. Of these, 59 patients had disease recurrence or had died by the data-cutoff date: 14 in the alectinib group and 45 in the chemotherapy group. The disease-free survival among patients with stage II or IIIA disease at 2 years was 93.8% in the alectinib group and 63.0% in the chemotherapy group; the values at 3 years were 88.3% and 53.3%, respectively. The hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death was 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 0.45; P<0.001), which corresponds to a 76% lower risk with adjuvant alectinib than with chemotherapy. Kaplan–Meier curves for disease-free survival show early and sustained separation between the alectinib group and the chemotherapy group ([Figure 1A]()). \nFigure 1 \nDisease-free Survival among Patients with Stage II or IIIA Disease and in the Intention-to-Treat Population. \nThe intention-to-treat population included patients with stage IB, II, or IIIA disease who had undergone randomization.

The widths of the confidence intervals (indicated by shaded areas) have not been adjusted for multiplicity and may not be used in place of hypothesis testing. Tick marks indicate censored data. NE denotes could not be estimated. \nThe intention-to-treat population included 257 patients: 130 in the alectinib group and 127 in the chemotherapy group. Of these, 65 patients had disease recurrence or death: 15 in the alectinib group and 50 in the chemotherapy group. The disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population at 2 years was 93.6% in the alectinib group and 63.7% in the chemotherapy group; the values at 3 years were 88.7% and 54.0%, respectively. The hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death in the alectinib group as compared with the chemotherapy group in the intention-to-treat population was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.43; P<0.001)([Figure 1B]()). \nThe disease-free survival benefit from adjuvant alectinib as compared with chemotherapy was generally consistent across all subgroups ([Figure 2]()). This consistency was seen in subgroups defined according to disease stage (Fig. S3), race, sex, and smoking status. \nFigure 2 \nSubgroup Analysis of Disease-free Survival. \nRace was reported by the patient.

The most common site of recurrence was the brain, reported in 4 patients in the alectinib group and 14 in the chemotherapy group (Table S3). The hazard ratio for CNS disease recurrence or death was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.58) in favor of alectinib([Figure 3]()). After disease recurrence, at least one subsequent treatment was given to 13 patients in the alectinib group and 43 patients in the chemotherapy group (Table S4), most frequently alectinib (4 patients and 29 patients, respectively). \nFigure 3 \nCentral Nervous System (CNS) Disease–free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population. \nThe widths of the confidence intervals (indicated by shaded areas) have not been adjusted for multiplicity and may not be used in place of hypothesis testing.

An additional patient in the chemotherapy group died, but data for this patient were censored owing to incomplete date of death recorded.\n### Safety\nThe safety-evaluable population included 128 patients who received alectinib and 120 patients who received chemotherapy. The median duration of treatment for the safety-evaluable population was 23.9 months with alectinib and 2.1 months with chemotherapy. The median dose intensity was 99.4% and 100%, respectively. \nAt least one adverse event was reported by 98.4% of the patients in the alectinib group and 93.3% of those in the chemotherapy group ([Table 2]()). The majority were grade 1 or 2 events. No grade 5 (fatal) adverse events were reported.The most commonly reported adverse events were increased creatine kinase levels (43.0%) and constipation (42.2%) in the alectinib group and nausea (72.5%) and decreased appetite (29.2%) in the chemotherapy group.Adverse events of any grade that were considered by the investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 93.8% of the patients in the alectinib group and 89.2% of those in the chemotherapy group; grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18.0% and 27.5%, respectively. \nTable 2 \n\n\n|Adverse Event |Alectinib(N=128) |Chemotherapy(N=120) | | |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| |Any Grade |Grade 3 or 4 |Any Grade |Grade 3 or 4 |\n| |number of patients (percent) | | | |\n|Any adverse event |126 (98.4) |38 (29.7) |112 (93.3) |37 (30.8) |\n|Nausea |10 (7.8) |0 |87 (72.5) |5 (4.2) |\n|Creatine kinase increased |55 (43.0) |8 (6.2) |1 (0.8) |1 (0.8) |\n|Constipation |54 (42.2) |1 (0.8) |30 (25.0) |1 (0.8) |\n|Aspartate aminotransferase increased |53 (41.4) |1 (0.8) |6 (5.0) |0 |\n|Alanine aminotransferase increased |43 (33.6) |2 (1.6) |11 (9.2) |0 |\n|Blood bilirubin increased |43 (33.6) |2 (1.6) |1 (0.8) |0 |\n|Decreased appetite |7 (5.5) |0 |35 (29.2) |1 (0.8) |\n|Covid-19 |37 (28.9) |0 |1 (0.8) |0 |\n|Myalgia |36 (28.1) |1 (0.8) |2 (1.7) |0 |\n|Anemia |30 (23.4) |0 |31 (25.8) |1 (0.8) |\n|Vomiting |9 (7.0) |0 |30 (25.0) |2 (1.7) |\n|Alkaline phosphatase increased |32 (25.0) |0 |4 (3.3) |0 |\n|White-cell count decreased |2 (1.6) |0 |23 (19.2) |4 (3.3) |\n|Neutrophil count decreased |3 (2.3) |0 |21 (17.5) |12 (10.0) |\n|Asthenia |14 (10.9) |0 |19 (15.8) |3 (2.5) |\n|Neutropenia |2 (1.6) |0 |19 (15.8) |10 (8.3) |\n|Creatinine increased |19 (14.8) |1 (0.8) |6 (5.0) |0 |\n|Cough |19 (14.8) |1 (0.8) |4 (3.3) |0 |\n|Fatigue |18 (14.1) |1 (0.8) |16 (13.3) |2 (1.7) |\n|Rash |18 (14.1) |1 (0.8) |7 (5.8) |0 |\n|Malaise |6 (4.7) |0 |16 (13.3) |0 |\n|Weight increased |17 (13.3) |1 (0.8) |1 (0.8) |0 |\n|Diarrhea |16 (12.5) |1 (0.8) |10 (8.3) |1 (0.8) |\n|Headache |14 (10.9) |0 |8 (6.7) |0 |\n|Dyspnea |13 (10.2) |1 (0.8) |3 (2.5) |0 |\n|Dysgeusia |13 (10.2) |0 |3 (2.5) |0 |\n|Edema, peripheral |13 (10.2) |0 |1 (0.8) |0 | \nAdverse Events Occurring in at Least 10% of Patients in Either Trial Group (Safety-Evaluable Population).[*]() \n* \nThe safety-evaluable population included patients who underwent randomization and received any amount of alectinib or chemotherapy. Adverse events are listed according to*Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities*preferred term. The median duration of treatment was 23.9 months in the alectinib group and 2.1 months in the chemotherapy group. No grade 5 events were observed. Multiple occurrences of the same adverse event in an individual patient are counted only once. Covid-19 denotes coronavirus disease 2019. \nSerious adverse events were reported in 17 patients (13.3%) in the alectinib group and 10 patients (8.3%) in the chemotherapy group (Table S5). All serious adverse events that were considered to be related to treatment with alectinib were resolved. \nAdverse events that led to dose reduction were reported in 25.8% of the patients in the alectinib group and 10.0% of those in the chemotherapy group, and adverse events that led to dose interruption were reported in 27.3% and 18.3%, respectively.Adverse events that led to dose discontinuation were reported in 5.5% of the patients in the alectinib group and 12.5% of those in the chemotherapy group.\n## Discussion\nIn the phase 3, randomized ALINA trial, patients with resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC who received adjuvant alectinib had significantly longer disease-free survival than those who received the standard adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.The hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death was 0.24 among patients with stage II or IIIA NSCLC and in the intention-to-treat population, which corresponds to a 76% lower risk with adjuvant alectinib than with chemotherapy. The disease-free survival benefit was seen consistently across prespecified subgroups, including those defined according to disease stage, race, sex, and smoking status. \nDisease-free survival is a well-established efficacy end point for trials of adjuvant therapy in resectable NSCLC. Most cases of recurrence after surgery are incurable, with metastatic spread and poor prognosis,[21–27,37]()so improved disease-free survival with alectinib represents a meaningful benefit to patients. Recent data for adjuvant osimertinib in resected*EGFR*-positive NSCLC indicate the potential for a large disease-free survival benefit with a highly effective TKI to translate into an overall survival benefit in the adjuvant context.[29]()In the ALINA trial, longer follow-up will be needed to better understand the effect of adjuvant alectinib on overall survival. \nPatients with*ALK*-positive NSCLC are at high risk for brain metastases, which are associated with poor prognosis and have a substantial effect on health-related quality of life.[14,38]()In the ALINA trial, recurrence in the brain was observed in fewer patients in the alectinib group (4 [3.1%]) than in the chemotherapy group (14 [11.0%]). An exploratory analysis showed a clinically meaningful prolongation of CNS disease–free survival with alectinib. These early data suggest that adjuvant alectinib can prevent or delay CNS recurrence, findings consistent with the intracranial efficacy of alectinib in advanced NSCLC.[15,34,35]() \nThe safety profile of adjuvant alectinib was consistent with that in previous reports in the context of advanced disease, with laboratory abnormalities and constipation being the most frequent adverse events, and no new safety concerns were identified.[30-32]()Although treatment duration with adjuvant alectinib was much longer than with chemotherapy (median of 2 years vs. 2 months), similar numbers of adverse events were observed in the two groups, and the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment owing to adverse events was lower with alectinib (5.5%) than with chemotherapy (12.5%). Long-term follow up will be needed to assess any potential long-term toxic effects of adjuvant alectinib. \nSome aspects of the design of the ALINA trial differ from previous phase 3 trials of adjuvant targeted therapy.[7]()An open-label trial design was used in order to make a head-to-head comparison between a chemotherapy-free regimen of 2 years of adjuvant oral alectinib and standard adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy, for which blinding would not be feasible.Chemotherapy-free regimens have potential benefits with respect to adverse-event profile, could allow chemotherapy to be reserved as a treatment option after disease recurrence, and may be preferred by patients and their families.[39]()However, our trial does not address the potential additional usefulness of adding chemotherapy to alectinib. This approach could allow intensification of therapy in selected groups of patients and should be investigated in future clinical trials. \nIn the ALINA trial, the choice of treatment after disease recurrence was at the discretion of the investigators, because the trial did not have a formal crossover design. ALK TKIs were the most common systemic therapies after recurrence in both groups, the majority being second- and third-generation, CNS-penetrant ALK TKIs, including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib. These post-recurrence treatments are consistent with current clinical practice and global guidelines for advanced disease.[2-4]() \nThe most effective timing and duration of adjuvant targeted therapy in resectable NSCLC has not yet been established. A 2-year treatment duration was chosen for the ALINA trial to balance the potential benefits of longer durations of adjuvant alectinib with limiting the burden of an extended treatment duration. A need remains for prospective trials to identify the most effective treatment duration of adjuvant targeted therapies in resectable NSCLC, which may differ for different patients depending on factors such as the molecular profile of tumors or the presence of minimal residual disease.[40,41]()Future studies are planned to investigate a combination of chemotherapy and alectinib, as well as a longer duration of treatment with adjuvant alectinib. \nThe data from the ALINA trial reinforce the need for rapid biomarker testing for*ALK*alterations across all stages of NSCLC.*ALK*testing is well established in advanced NSCLC and is increasingly becoming standard in the context of early-stage disease.[2,4]()Currently, biomarker testing for*ALK*alterations in resectable NSCLC is mainly performed to exclude patients from receiving immunotherapy, but routine*ALK*testing should also support identification of patients who are likely to benefit from adjuvant alectinib. \nAdjuvant alectinib showed a significant benefit with respect to disease-free survival as compared with chemotherapy, as well as a mainly low-grade safety profile with few discontinuations due to adverse events. Adjuvant alectinib represents an important efficacious new treatment strategy for patients with resected*ALK*-positive NSCLC of stage IB, II, or IIIA. \n\n## Notes\nA[data sharing statement]()provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. \nSupported byF.

Few cytotoxic drugs currently registered produce more than a 15% response rate as a single agent or 30%-35% in combination, with only modest survival benefits. New cytotoxic drugs entering phase II and III studies, however, appear to have more than 20% activity against this disease. They include the taxanes (taxol and taxotere), camptothecin analogues (CPT-11 and topotecan), antimetabolites (edatrexate and gemcitabine) and the vinca alkaloid, navelbine. Taxol produces response rates of about 25% in previously untreated patients and is currently undergoing trials at higher doses in combination with cisplatin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Taxotere produces response rates of 33% in previously untreated patients and 21% in patients previously refractory to platinum-containing regimens. The camptothecin analogues, which are inhibitors of topoisomerase I, may produce response rates of up to 41% in previously untreated patients, but these results have varied considerably between different trials (response rates as low as 13.5% have been reported for topotecan). A phase II study with edatrexate produced a response rate of 32% but subsequent trials using combination chemotherapy including this agent have been disappointing. The activity of gemcitabine as a single agent is 20%-25%. Three ongoing phase II studies combining cisplatin and gemcitabine have shown response rates of up to 50%. Gemcitabine has minimal subjective toxicity. Navelbine produces response rates of 22%-33% as a single agent and up to 65% in combination. These new cytotoxic agents with significant activity in non-small cell lung cancer provide exciting potential for developing novel combination regimens in the advanced setting and as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy.\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: Phase II and III studies; 研究目标: Response rates to new cytotoxic drugs; 研究人群: non-small cell lung cancer patients; 研究结论: Taxol produces response rates of about 25% in previously untreated patients; Taxotere produces response rates of 33% in previously untreated patients and 21% in patients previously refractory to platinum-containing regimens; Camptothecin analogues may produce response rates of up to 41% in previously untreated patients; Edatrexate produced a response rate of 32%; Gemcitabine as a single agent has a response rate of 20%-25%, and in combination with cisplatin, it can reach up to 50%; Navelbine produces response rates of 22%-33% as a single agent and up to 65% in combination.", "label": 1}, {"content": "url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8096453/\n标题: New directions for chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.\n作者: M R Green\n来源期刊: Chest\n发布时间: 1993年04月01日\n内容: Currently, only a few chemotherapeutic agents (ifosfamide, mitomycin, vinblastine, and vindesine) have consistently produced single-agent response rates greater than 15% in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While combination chemotherapy with these and other agents may prolong survival in some patients with advanced disease, complete responses and long-term disease control are achieved only infrequently. In recent years, several new drugs have produced single-agent response rates above 20% in phase I/II trials. These results have brightened the prospects for chemotherapy against NSCLC.

Until recently, chemotherapy - characterized by some benefit but only rare durable responses - was the only treatment option for patients with NSCLC whose tumors lacked targetable mutations. By contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated distinctly durable responses and represent the advent of a new treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Three immune checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, are now approved for use in first- and/or second-line settings for selected patients with advanced NSCLC, with promising benefit also seen in patients with stage III NSCLC. Additionally, durvalumab following chemoradiation has been approved for use in patients with locally advanced disease. Due to the distinct features of cancer immunotherapy, and rapid progress in the field, clinical guidance is needed on the use of these agents, including appropriate patient selection, sequencing of therapies, response monitoring, adverse event management, and biomarker testing. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened an expert Task Force charged with developing consensus recommendations on these key issues. Following a systematic process as outlined by the National Academy of Medicine, a literature search and panel voting were used to rate the strength of evidence for each recommendation.

Typically, GST pull-down experiments are used to identify interactions between a probe protein and unknown targets and to confirm suspected interactions between a probe protein and a known protein[2](),[3](). The probe protein is a GST fusion, whose coding sequence is cloned into an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible expression vector. This fusion protein is expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads. Target proteins are usually lysates of cells, either labeled with [35S]methionine or unlabeled, depending on the method used to assay the interaction between the target and the probe. The cell lysate and the GST fusion protein are incubated together with glutathione-agarose beads. Complexes recovered from the beads are resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting, autoradiography or staining. \n\n## Procedure\n\n### Precleaning the cell lysate\n\n\n1| Incubate the cell lysate with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads and 25 μg of GST for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The amount of lysate needed to detect an interaction is highly variable. Start with a volume of lysate equivalent to 1 × 106–1 × 107cells.\n\n*Because the aim of the experiment is to compare GST with a GST fusion protein, it is necessary to prepare enough precleared lysate for each reaction. Efficient mixing of reagents is the key to success and is best achieved if the reaction is carried out in a reasonable volume: 500–1,000 μl is a good starting point. Typically a cell lysate is used in which the proteins are labeled with**35**S. It is, however, possible to use unlabeled cell lysates, depending on the goals of the experiment and the desired detection method*.\n\n2| Centrifuge the mixture at maximum speed for 2 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge.\n\n3| Transfer the supernatant (the precleared cell lysate) to a clean microcentrifuge tube.\n### Probing the cell lysate\n\n\n4| Set up two microcentrifuge tubes, each containing equal amounts of precleared cell lysate and 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. To one tube add∼10 μg of GST protein; to the other tube add∼10 μg of the GST fusion probe protein.\n\n*The amount of probe and control protein added should be equimolar in the two reactions (that is, the final molar concentration of GST should be the same as that of the GST fusion probe protein)*.\n\n5| Incubate the tubes for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing, and centrifuge the samples at maximum speed for 2 min in a microcentrifuge.\n\n6| Save the supernatants at 4 °C in clean microcentrifuge tubes. These samples will be analyzed by SDS-PAGE in step 9.\n\n7| Wash the beads four times with 1 ml of ice-cold GST lysis buffer. Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. Discard the supernatants.\n\n*GST lysis buffer consists of 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/μl aprotinin, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)*.\n\n8| Optional: Elute the GST fusion protein and any proteins bound to it by adding 50 μl of 20 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) to the beads. Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed for 2 min in a microcentrifuge.\n### Detecting interacting proteins\n\n\n9| Analyze the beads (from**step 7**) or the eluted proteins (from**step 8**) by SDS-PAGE. Detect the proteins associated with the GST fusion protein by one of the following means.\n\n*The method of detecting proteins associated with the GST fusion protein will depend on whether or not the cell lysate was radiolabeled and on the goal of the experiment*.\n\n**If the goal is to detect all of the****35****S-labeled proteins associated with the fusion protein:**\n\nDry the gel on a gel dryer and expose it to X-ray film to produce an autoradiograph.\n\n**If the goal is to detect specific associated proteins:**\n\nTransfer the proteins from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a membrane and perform immunoblotting.\n\n**If the goal is to determine the sizes and abundance of proteins associated with the fusion protein from a nonradioactive lysate:**\n\nStain the gel with Coomassie blue or silver nitrate. \n\n## Source\n\n\nThis protocol was adapted from “Detection of protein-protein interactions using the GST fusion protein pull-down technique,” in[Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual]()(eds.

\n\n\nGST，全称为glutathione-S-transferase，即为谷胱甘肽-S-转移酶蛋白，可以与谷胱甘肽（glutathione，GSH）结合，其与CoIP实验都是验证蛋白互作的有效方法。\n\n \n\n**GST pull-down和与CoIP的区别**\n\n**GST pull-down**一般用于体外实验，因为诱饵蛋白是需要加上GST标签的重组蛋白，所以是非生理状态下的验证，蛋白质的结构和形式可能与天然状态下存在一定差异，一般用于体外验证两个已知蛋白的直接相互作用。\n\n在实验难度上，重组诱饵蛋白一般采用原核表达体系，有高效的商业化载体（真核表表达体系也可以做，但需要找到合适的载体）；并且固相复合物组分更少，有商业化的GSH琼脂糖珠，整个实验相对而言难度较低。\n\n**Co-IP**反映的是两个蛋白在体内或细胞水平的相互作用，因为在进行CoIP检测时，样本一般源于非变性裂解细胞，活细胞状态下蛋白质之间的相互作用被保持，所以其反映的是细胞中真实的蛋白互作情况，但是诱饵蛋白和靶标蛋白之间是直接作用还是有其它蛋白介导的间接相互作用无法确定。\n\n在实验难度上，因为固相复合物组分多，需要非变性环境，并且对诱饵蛋白抗体的质量有较高要求，整个实验相对而言难度较大。\n\n综合而言，GST pull-down实验和Co-IP实验其实是相互补充的两种实验方法，通过二者结合，我们才能更准确地了解两个蛋白之间的真实互作情况。\n\n**1、GST pull-down基本概念**\n\n利用重组技术将探针蛋白与GST谷胱苷肽巯基转移酶融合，融合蛋白通过GST与固相化在球珠上的GSH谷胱甘肽结合，从而分离出能与融合蛋白相互作用是的蛋白。GST pull-down 研究对象是蛋白质与蛋白质之间的相互作用。 \n\n\n\n\n**2、GST pull-down结合原理**\n\nGST pull-down利用DNA重组技术将探针蛋白与GST谷胱苷肽巯基转移酶融合。融合蛋白通过谷胱苷肽巯基转移酶与载体上的谷胱苷肽分子特异性亲和原理，从而实现融合的探针蛋白与谷胱苷肽包被的琼脂糖球珠特异性结合。 \n\n\n\n\n**3、GST pull-down 分离原理**\n\nGST pull-down中所用到的琼脂糖球珠载体由于其复合体比重大（而非体系蛋白比重小），能够能借助离心力更快速的沉淀分离。在经过漂洗、离心之后就可以达到分离探针蛋白的目的。 \n\n\n\n\n**4、GST pull-down 实验流程**\n\n**①蛋白的抽提与纯化：原核表达蛋白分离纯化。**\n\n在裂解液上清中加入适量体积50%谷胱甘肽-琼脂糖凝胶4B，4℃摇床上缓慢摇动30~60min;\n\n4℃，4000rpm离心5min，弃去上清；\n\n加入200ul预冷的PBS溶液，轻晃悬浮珠子，洗涤一次，4℃，4000rpm离心5min，弃去上清，重复此步骤3次；\n\n吸走珠子表面的液体，但注意不要吸走珠子，即可获得结合GST-A的琼脂糖凝胶。 \n\n\n\n\n**②真核表达蛋白抽提** \n\n\n\n\n**③体系孵育与pull-down**\n\n混合含有A-GST蛋白和含有其他蛋白的溶液，将混合物在4°C旋转混匀孵育过夜;\n\n4℃，4000rpm离心5min，弃去上清液后，用预冷缓冲液进行洗涤，重复三次；\n\n吸干琼脂糖凝胶上方的水层后，加入1×蛋白电泳上样缓冲液，将蛋白样本煮好后，分装冻存于-80℃冰箱，用于后续检测。 \n\n\n\n\n**④GST pull-down 验证与结果分析**\n\nGST pull-down实验经过考马斯亮蓝和Western blot检测后即可进行结果分析。 \n\n\n**考马斯亮蓝检测：**通过考染胶中纯化条带区别于未纯化样品条带的分布情况，可以明显看出纯化后的探针蛋白A，在实验组与对照组中都有分布；下面与蛋白A互作的未知蛋白在实验组中存在，在对照组中不存在。证明实验体系与结果准确有效。 \n\n\n**Western blot检测：**探针蛋白A明显存在于Input组和实验组中，并且阴性组中没有，证明实验体系洗脱充分有效；下面出现的互作的未知蛋白在Input组和实验组中有明显条带，且在阴性组中没有条带，证明实验结果准确可靠。 \n\n\n\n\n**5、GST pull down实验对照与结果解读实例**\n\n**①GST pull-down实验对照设置**\n\n**Input**\n\n证明样品中加入了对应的蛋白，以及加入的蛋白量。\n\n实验组中加入的是GST融合蛋白，对照组是GST蛋白，实验组和对照组都加入His融合蛋白，目的是证明GST标签不会和His融合蛋白有相互作用。 \n\n**Pull down**\n\n通过GSH Beads 沉淀GST蛋白或GST融合蛋白，如果GST融合蛋白能够拉下His融合蛋白，而GST不能拉下His融合蛋白，则说明A蛋白和B蛋白有相互作用\n\n都拉下来或者都拉不下来则不能说明A蛋白和B蛋白有相互作用。\n\n**②结果解读** \n\n\n作者在GST的N端融合Sw-5b蛋白，在NSm21蛋白添加YFP标签便于免疫印迹。\n\nGST pull down+YFP IB组：表示GST pull down实验后用YFP进行免疫印迹。发现GST + NSm21-YFP组和GST-Sw-5b + YFP组无条带，表明GST pull down体系中的GST与NSm21-YFP，GST-Sw-5b与YFP组分之间无互作，是阴性对照组。GST-Sw-5b + NSm21-YFP组有条带，表明两种物质之间存在互作，结合阴性对照组结果证明是Sw-5b 与NSm21之间存在互作。\n\nGST pull down+GST IB组：表示GST pull down实验后用GST进行免疫印迹。发现三组均有条带，表明GST pull down实验体系可以正常发挥功能，也表明各组体系中含有GST相关的组分。\n\nInput + YFP IB组：表示不经过GST pull down实验，直接对实验前各组的混合体系用YFP进行免疫印迹，是阳性对照组表明各组有YFP相关组分。\n\n \n\n**6、GST pull-down 实验优缺点**\n\n**实验优点**\n\n①可验证蛋白质-蛋白质之间的直接互作反应，区别于co-ip的复杂细胞背景，是体外验证蛋白质分子互作的经典方法。\n\n②GSH谷胱甘肽偶联球珠亲和力强，洗脱纯度高，能够分离出纯度更高的蛋白体系。 \n\n\n**实验缺点**\n\n①验证蛋白质互作是在试管中进行的生化反应，不能够完全反应细胞内蛋白真实互作状态\n\n②融合表达的GST标签肽链较长，可能会改变原目的蛋白原有的折叠结构。 \n\n\n\n\n**7、GST pull-down常见问题解答**\n\n①如果蛋白表达在包涵体中是否可以进行后续GST pull- down实验？\n\n包涵体是由于蛋白未正确折叠而聚集形成的。可以使用高浓度的尿素和盐酸胍使其变性解聚，变性后的蛋白可能需要通过逐步去除变性剂并加入适当的缓冲液来重新折叠，以恢复其功能性构象，然后尝试进行后续的GST pull-down实验。\n\n②GST pull-down实验结果含有大量背景信号，怎么办？\n\n背景信号可能来自于非特异性结合。可以尝试增加洗脱步骤次数、使用更严格的洗脱条件，或添加非特异性结合抑制剂如BSA。\n\n③GST pull-down实验得到的蛋白带模糊不清，怎么提高分辨率？\n\n这可能是由于洗脱条件不足或蛋白纯度不高。可以增加洗脱液中洗脱剂的浓度，提高纯度，或使用其他柱层析方法提纯蛋白。\n\n④如何减少GST pull-down中的假阳性结果？\n\n假阳性结果主要是由于自发形成的聚集态，非特异的吸附和其他非特异性相互作用引起的。为了减少GST pull-down中的假阳性结果，通过添加更多的非离子型洗涤剂和用特定的pH缓冲液来消除这些非特异性的互作，同时在检测前应该用0.1％的Tween-20（或其他洗涤剂）处理GST-beads。\n\n④择适合的阴性对照组？\n\n选用不含目的蛋白的空GST蛋白作为阴性对照，以评估GST beads的特异性并排除假阳性结果。\n\n⑤GST pull-down的温度和时间应该如何选择？\n\n通常全程实验温度为4℃，时间为2-4小时，但也需要根据实验情况可能需要调整。\n\n⑥co-IP能验证到互作，为什么GST pull-down却验证不到？\n\nCo-IP是体内实验，可能检测到基于其他蛋白作为桥梁的间接互作，而GST pull-down证明的是两个蛋白的直接相互作用，如果中间桥梁缺失，则不会呈现互作状态。\n\n**科研资源汇总**\n\n扫描下方福麦斯生物二维码，回复对应的资源关键词就能在公众号下载资源

is to provide a method for the identification of new protein-protein interactions. Pull-down experiments with GST fusion proteins attached to glutathione beads are a screening technique for identification of protein-protein interactions. When coupled with mass spectrometry, pull-downs can be considered as the protein-based equivalent of a yeast two-hybrid screen. To improve the isolation of specific binding partners, pull-down methods are described involving the use of cross-linking, large-scale tissue lysates, and spin columns. Alternative techniques are detailed for isolating activation state-dependent protein interactions with small GTPases. Appropriate methods of sample preparation for mass spectrometry-based identification of interacting proteins are described, including specialized gel staining techniques, band excision, and in-gel tryptic digestion. Data interpretation and the most commonly encountered problems are discussed.\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: Literature Review", "label": 1}, {"content": "url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24259493/\n标题: Single-step protease cleavage elution for identification of protein-protein interactions from GST pull-down and mass spectrometry.\n作者: Lin Luo,Nathan P King,Jeremy C Yeo,Alun Jones,Jennifer L Stow\n来源期刊: Proteomics\n发布时间: 2013年11月22日\n内容: The study of protein-protein interactions is a major theme in biological disciplines. Pull-down or affinity-precipitation assays using GST fusion proteins have become one of the most common and valuable approaches to identify novel binding partners for proteins of interest (bait). Non-specific binding of prey proteins to the beads or to GST itself, however, inevitably complicates and impedes subsequent analysis of pull-down results. A variety of measures, each with inherent advantages and limitations, can minimise the extent of the background. This technical brief details and tests a modification of established GST pull-down protocols. By specifically eluting only the bait (minus the GST tag) and the associated non-specific binding proteins with a simple, single-step protease cleavage, a cleaner platform for downstream protein identification with MS is established. We present a proof of concept for this method, as evidenced by a GST pull-down/MS case study of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab31 in which: (i) sensitivity was enhanced, (ii) a reduced level of background was observed, (iii) distinguishability of non-specific contaminant proteins from genuine binders was improved and (iv) a putative new protein-protein interaction was discovered. Our protease cleavage step is readily applicable to all further affinity tag pull-downs.\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: Observational Study; 研究目标: Enhanced sensitivity, reduced background, improved distinguishability of non-specific contaminants, discovery of a new protein-protein interaction; 研究结论: A modified GST pull-down protocol using a single-step protease cleavage for elution was tested.

This methodology has been especially useful for investigating the interactions of nuclear hormone receptors with a wide variety of their interacting partners and coregulatory proteins. Unfortunately, the original GST-pulldown technique relies on multiple binding, washing and elution steps performed in individual microfuge tubes, and requires repeated centrifugation, aspiration, and suspension steps. This type of batch processing creates a significant liquid handling bottleneck, limiting the number of sample points that can be incorporated into one experiment and producing inherently less efficient washing and elution than would a flow-through methodology. In this manuscript, we describe the adaptation of this GST-pulldown assay to a 96-well filter plate format. The use of a multi-well filter plate makes it possible to assay more samples in significantly less time using less reagents and more efficient sample processing than does the traditional single tube assay.\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: In Vitro Trial", "label": 2}, {"content": "url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11891216/\n标题: The PDZ proteins PICK1, GRIP, and syntenin bind multiple glutamate receptor subtypes.

GST-pull-down experiments identified more interactions than detected by yeast two-hybrid assays. We report several receptor-protein interactions, strong ones include: (i) GRIP and syntenin with mGluR7a, mGluR4a, and mGluR6; (ii) PICK1 and GRIP with mGluR3; and (iii) syntenin with all forms of GluR1-4 and mGluR7b. We further characterized the novel mGluR7a-GRIP interaction found both in yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull-down assays and observed that mGluR7a localization overlapped with GRIP with in hippocampal neurons. The wide range of targets for PICK1, GRIP, and syntenin suggests they may represent a molecular mechanism that can concentrate and/or regulate a number of different receptors at a common site on a synapse. These data also suggest that the structural determinants involved in PDZ interactions are more complex than originally envisaged.\n论文研究信息: 研究地点: United Kingdom, Japan; 研究方法: Yeast two-hybrid assays, GST-pull-down approaches; 研究目标: Identify interactions between PDZ proteins and glutamate receptor subunits; 研究结论: Reported several receptor-protein interactions, including GRIP and syntenin with mGluR7a, mGluR4a, and mGluR6; PICK1 and GRIP with mGluR3; and syntenin with all forms of GluR1-4 and mGluR7b.

This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and important points for providers regarding NSAIDs.\n\n**Objectives:**\n+ \nIdentify the mechanism of action of NSAIDs.\n+ \nDescribe the potential adverse effects of NSAIDs.\n+ \nReview the potential toxicity of NSAIDs.\n+ \nSummarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes when using NSAID therapy.[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.]()\n\n[Go to:]()\n## Indications\n\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a drug class FDA-approved for use as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic agents.[\\[1\\]]() These effects make NSAIDs useful for treating muscle pain, dysmenorrhea, arthritic conditions, pyrexia, gout, migraines, and used as opioid-sparing agents in certain acute trauma cases.[\\[2\\]]()[\\[3\\]]()[\\[4\\]]()\n\nNSAIDs are typically divided into groups based on their chemical structure and selectivity: acetylated salicylates (aspirin), non-acetylated salicylates (diflunisal, salsalate), propionic acids (naproxen, ibuprofen, acetic acids (diclofenac, indomethacin), enolic acids (meloxicam, piroxicam) anthranilic acids (meclofenamate, mefenamic acid), naphthylalanine (nabumetone), and selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, etoricoxib). \n\nTopical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) are also available for use in acute tenosynovitis, ankle sprains, and soft tissue injuries.[\\[5\\]]()[\\[6\\]]()[\\[7\\]]()[\\[8\\]]()\n\nListed below are the FDA-approved NSAIDs (organized alphabetically):\n\n**Non-selective NSAIDs**\n+ \nDiclofenac\n+ \nDiflunisal\n+ \nEtodolac\n+ \nFenoprofen\n+ \nFlurbiprofen\n+ \nIbuprofen\n+ \nIndomethacin\n+ \nKetoprofen\n+ \nKetorolac\n+ \nMefenamic acid\n+ \nMeloxicam\n+ \nNabumetone\n+ \nNaproxen\n+ \nOxaprozin\n+ \nPiroxicam\n+ \nSulindac\n+ \nTolmetin\n\n**COX-2 Selective NSAIDs**\n+ \nCelecoxib\n+ \nRofecoxib\n+ \nValdecoxib\n\n(However, rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn from the market in 2004 and 2005, respectively) \n[Go to:]()\n## Mechanism of Action\n\n\nThe main mechanism of action of NSAIDs is the inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Cyclooxygenase is required to convert arachidonic acid into thromboxanes, prostaglandins, and prostacyclins.[\\[9\\]]()The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs are attributed to the lack of these eicosanoids. Specifically, thromboxanes play a role in platelet adhesion, prostaglandins cause vasodilation, increase the temperature set-point in the hypothalamus, and play a role in anti-nociception. \n\nThere are two cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 gets constitutively expressed in the body, and it plays a role in maintaining gastrointestinal mucosa lining, kidney function, and platelet aggregation. COX-2 is not constitutively expressed in the body; and instead, it inducibly expresses during an inflammatory response. Most of the NSAIDs are nonselective and inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. However, COX-2 selective NSAIDs (ex. celecoxib) only target COX-2 and therefore have a different side effect profile. Importantly, because COX-1 is the prime mediator for ensuring gastric mucosal integrity and COX-2 is mainly involved in inflammation, COX-2 selective NSAIDs should provide anti-inflammatory relief without compromising the gastric mucosa.[\\[10\\]]() \n[Go to:]()\n## Administration\n\n\nMost commonly, NSAIDs are available as oral tablets. According to the package insert, the dosage for the most common over-the-counter NSAIDs are as follows:\n+ \nIbuprofen: for 200 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours while symptoms persist. The daily limit for ibuprofen is 1200 mg. \n+ \nAspirin regular strength: for 325 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours, or 3 tablets every 6 hours. The daily limit for aspirin is 4000 mg.\n+ \nNaproxen sodium: for 220 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 8 to 12 hours. The daily limit for naproxen sodium is 660 mg. \n\nTopical NSAIDs are also available (diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution, diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine 1.3% patch, and diclofenac sodium gel 1%). They are most useful for treating pain due to soft-tissue injuries and osteoarthritis.[\\[8\\]]()\n\nSpecific NSAIDs can also be administered parenterally; for example, intravenous ibuprofen is available, given as a 30-minute infusion; this can be used as a non-opioid analgesic to manage pain and can also reduce fever. Trials have shown that using intravenous ibuprofen and morphine in postoperative adult patients can lower the total use of morphine. For treating pyrexia, an initial 400mg dose then 400 or 100 to 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. For the treatment of pain, 400 to 800 mg, every 6 hours as needed, is the recommended dose regimen.[\\[11\\]]() Ketorolac is also available for parenteral administration. \n[Go to:]()\n## Adverse Effects\n\n\nNSAIDs have well-known adverse effects affecting the gastric mucosa, renal system, cardiovascular system, hepatic system, and hematologic system.\n\n**Gastric adverse effects**are likely due to the inhibition of COX-1, preventing the creation of prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. The damage is more likely in a patient that has a prior history of peptic ulcers. Since it is COX-1 specific, the use of COX-2 selective NSAIDs is a lower-risk alternative.[\\[12\\]]()\n\n**Renal adverse effects** are because COX-1 and COX-2 facilitate the production of prostaglandins that play a role in renal hemodynamics. In a patient with normal renal function, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis does not pose a large problem; however, in a patient with renal dysfunction, these prostaglandins play a greater role and can be the source of problems when reduced via NSAIDs. Complications that can occur include acute renal dysfunction, fluid and electrolyte disorders, renal papillary necrosis, and nephrotic syndrome/ interstitial nephritis.[\\[13\\]]()\n\n**Cardiovascular adverse effects** can also be increased with NSAID use; these include MI, thromboembolic events, and atrial fibrillation. Diclofenac seems to be the NSAID with the highest reported increase in adverse cardiovascular events.[\\[14\\]]()\n\n**Hepatic adverse effects **are less common; NSAID-associated risk of hepatotoxicity (raised aminotransferase levels) is not very common, and liver-related hospitalization is very rare. Among the various NSAIDs, Diclofenac has a higher rate of hepatotoxic effects.[\\[15\\]]() \n\n**Hematologic adverse effects **are possible, particularly with nonselective NSAIDs due to their antiplatelet activity. This antiplatelet effect typically only poses a problem if the patient has a history of GI ulcers, diseases that impair platelet activity (hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand, etc.), and in some perioperative cases.[\\[16\\]]()\n\n**Other minor adverse effects**include anaphylactoid reactions that involve the skin and pulmonary systems, like urticaria and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.[\\[17\\]]()[\\[18\\]]()\n\nFor a complete list of adverse effects for an individual NSAID, please see the StatPearls article for that particular drug. \n[Go to:]()\n## Contraindications\n\n\nAccording to the package insert, NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients:\n+ \nWith NSAID hypersensitivity or salicylate hypersensitivity, as well as in patients who have experienced an allergic reaction (urticaria, asthma, etc.) after taking NSAIDs \n+ \nWho have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery\n+ \nDuring the third trimester of pregnancy \n[Go to:]()\n## Monitoring\n\n\nRecommended monitoring includes a CBC, renal tests, and hepatic panel. These recommendations are from the American College of Rheumatology for use in rheumatoid arthritis patients who use NSAIDs chronically and who have no comorbidities nor history of complications. Monitoring is less common in patients not considered high risk for NSAID toxicity. However, NSAIDs are either contraindicated, or their use requires monitoring in patients with liver or renal problems.[\\[19\\]]() \n[Go to:]()\n## Toxicity\n\n\nNSAID toxicity can manifest as GI bleeding, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, and renal damage. [\\[19\\]]() Typically, acute NSAID overdose is asymptomatic or has negligible gastrointestinal symptoms. However, other symptoms of toxicity complications may include anion gap metabolic acidosis, coma, convulsions, and acute renal failure. Also, NSAIDs can confer gastrointestinal damage by inhibiting COX-1, which causes decrease gastric mucosa production. Nephrotoxicity can also occur with NSAID use because these medications reduce prostaglandin levels, which are essential for the vasodilation of the renal arterioles. Lastly, neurologic toxicity can present with drowsiness, confusion, nystagmus, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, and tinnitus.[\\[20\\]]() \n[Go to:]()\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\n\nThe general public widely uses NSAIDs because of their wide range of commonly encountered indications. Patient education on the use of NSAIDs is an important piece of care that providers need to pay attention to because of the many possible adverse effects on multiple different organ systems. Because these adverse effects occur at a much higher rate in patients with specific comorbidities, it is crucial for physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to pay close attention to a patient's history and to educate the patient accordingly on risks and dosing. The treating clinician will initiate therapy, whether for a short or long-term regimen. The pharmacist will need to verify the dosing and administration and check for potential drug-drug interactions. Pharmacists should also offer patient counseling on how to best use their NSAID and minimize adverse events; this is particularly the case when the patient uses NSAIDs as an OTC agent. Nursing must also take a careful medication history and include OTC NSAID use, so the clinician can make an informed choice for prescribing NSAID therapy. MUrses, pharmacists, and clinicians all need to be cognizant of the signs and symptoms of NSAID toxicity or adverse effects to make changes to the patient's regimen as needed.\n\nThe healthcare team should communicate and work together to ensure that each patient receives the proper dose for their specific condition and comorbidities, high enough for efficacy but as low as possible to reduce the incidence of adverse effects. Through collaborative interprofessional teamwork, NSAID therapy can confer maximum benefit with minimal downside.

Most are derivatives of either salicylates, propionic acid, indoleacetic acid, anthranilic acid, pyrazolone, or oxicams. They depress the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid by reversible inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. In the kidney, prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2 modulate the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and vasopressin. In the presence of volume contraction, anesthesia, or disease states associated with high levels of these hormones, prostaglandins regulate glomerular filtration, vascular resistance, and renin secretion. They additionally influence urine volume and sodium content. In man, a syndrome of analgesic abuse that has been identified worldwide occurs more frequently in females than males and can result in severe renal damage, most notably renal papillary necrosis. Most common laboratory animals are relatively resistant to developing the renal lesion associated with NSAIDs unless high doses are given over long periods of time and some withholding of water is introduced into the protocol. Diuresis with 5% dextrose and water is protective. Studies of paracetamol and salicylate have demonstrated that these compounds concentrate in the papillary tip of the kidney at concentrations of 4 to 13 times the plasma levels in dogs and rabbits, respectively. Renal papillary necrosis has been described in horses on maintenance doses of phenylbutazone where dehydration or reduced water consumption has occurred. The lesion can be reproduced experimentally if water is withheld during a portion of the dosing interval. An increased incidence of uroepithelial tumors have been reported in patients with a history of analgesic abuse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: Animal Trial; 研究目标: Renal papillary necrosis; 研究结论: Renal papillary necrosis has been described in horses on maintenance doses of phenylbutazone where dehydration or reduced water consumption has occurred.

They produce various clinical manifestations and can affect different organs. Gastrointestinal reactions (pyrosis, vomiting, gastralgia), neurological reactions (tinnitus, deafness, vertigo), blood dyscrasias, and nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic reactions are well known.NSAIDs are the drugs of choice in the treatment of chronic arthropathies and other childhood connective-tissue diseases and are also commonly used in the treatment of febrile and acute inflammatory processes. Not all NAIDs are authorized for use in the pediatric population but their spectrum of use varies according to the entity for which they are indicated and the legislation of the country. Published studies on the prevalence of aspirin intolerance in patients with bronchial asthma show a fair amount of disagreement. This may be due to (i) the method of selecting asthmatic patients for the study, which differs according to whether all asthmatic patients are included or only those dependent on corticoids; (ii) the diagnostic method used, whether based on clinical criteria or oral provocation tests, which will affect the number of patients with a diagnosis of intolerance. In children aged less than 10 years, including children with asthma, the prevalence is low, while among children and young adults aged 10-20 years old, the prevalence is estimated at 10 %. Some hypotheses attempt to explain the mechanisms through which adverse reactions to NAIDs take place. One hypothesis attributes the reaction to a reaginic immunological mechanism but this hypothesis has only been confirmed in exceptional cases. The theory of the cyclooxygenase pathway, currently the most widely accepted, is based on the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to prostaglandin depletion and an increase in leukotrienes. The discovery of two isoforms of the cyclooxygenase enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, has represented a great advance in our understanding of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs and has also elucidated the problem of cross-reactivities. According to the theory of viral infection, aspirin-induced asthma could be caused by chronic viral infection since, after initial exposure to the virus, cytotoxic lymphocytes are produced. Their activity is inhibited by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2); aspirin and other NSAIDs block PGE2 production and allow cytotoxic lymphocytes to attack and eliminate the respiratory tract cells infected by the virus. During this reaction lysosomal enzymes and mediators are released, which could precipitate an asthmatic crisis.Clinically, five types of reaction have been identified: 1. Respiratory illness with aspirin sensitivity. 2. Aspirin-induced urticarial disease. 3. Allergic reactions to NSAIDs and aspirin. 4 and 5. Aseptic meningitis and pneumonitis due to hypersensitivity. The latter are exceptional and are published as case reports. They have never been associated with aspirin or acetaminophen and usually occur in patients undergoing prolonged treatment. Diagnosis is based on a detailed history. Skin tests are not valid and in vitro tests are not widely used. Provocation tests with aspirin and NSAIDs definitively identify sensitized patients but their indications and limitations should be kept in mind. In children, certain features of adverse reactions to NSAIDs are observed in relation to their incidence and clinical manifestations. Acetaminophen is considered the drug of choice but further studies of other alternatives in children are required.\n论文研究信息: 研究方法: Literature Review; 研究目标: adverse reactions to NSAIDs, prevalence of aspirin intolerance, mechanisms of adverse reactions, types of reactions; 研究人群: children; 研究结论: Adverse reactions to NSAIDs are common in children, especially in those with asthma. The prevalence of aspirin intolerance is low in children under 10 years old but estimated at 10% in those aged 10-20. Various mechanisms and theories exist to explain these reactions, including reaginic immunological mechanisms and the cyclooxygenase pathway.

The cervical lymph nodes are particularly important because they are the first drainage stations for key points of contact with the outside world (mouth/throat/nose/eyes/ears/respiratory system) – a critical aspect especially among children – and can represent an early clinical sign in their exposed position on a child’s slim neck.\n\nInvolvement of the lymph nodes in multiple conditions is accompanied by a correspondingly large number of available diagnostic procedures. In the interests of time, patient wellbeing and cost, a careful choice of these must be made to permit appropriate treatment. The basis of diagnostic decisions is a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. Sonography also plays an important role in differential diagnosis of lymph node swelling in children and is useful in answering one of the critical diagnostic questions: is there a suspicion of malignancy? If so, full dissection of the most conspicuous lymph node may be necessary to obtain histological confirmation.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of childhood cervical lymph node disorders present the attending pediatric and ENT physicians with some particular challenges. The spectrum of differential diagnoses and the varying degrees of clinical relevance – from banal infections to malignant diseases – demand a clear and considered approach to the child’s individual clinical presentation. Such an approach is described in the following paper.\n## 1 Introduction\n\n\nNeck masses are a symptom ENT physicians in hospitals and surgeries are frequently confronted with among children. If the mass originates from the lymph nodes, the first step should be to establish whether the lymph node itself is enlarged: this is the case above a diameter of >1 cm (in the angle of the mandible >1.5 cm) and is defined as lymphadenopathy. A distinction is made between an acute (<2 weeks), subacute (2–6 weeks) and chronic (>6 weeks) course of the lymphadenopathy [[1]()]. Enlarged lymph nodes must also be differentiated from other possible causes of neck masses, such as midline thyroglossal cysts and branchial cysts, lipoma, vascular malformations (e.g. hemangioma), paraganglioma/neurinoma, lesions of the salivary or thyroid glands, lymphangioma, teratoma, (epi-)dermoid cysts, and ectopic thyroid tissue [[2]()] (see Figure 1[\\(Fig. 1\\)](), Figure 2[\\(Fig. 2\\)](), Figure 3[\\(Fig. 3\\)](), Figure 4[\\(Fig. 4\\)]()).\n### Figure 1.

Branchial cyst.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n\nAs Table 1[\\(Tab. 1\\)]()shows, there are many possible causes of lymph node enlargement. For this reason, anamnesis and thorough clinical examination are crucial steps towards securing a diagnosis [[3]()].\n### Table 1. Possible causes of cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n## 2 Anamnesis\n\n\nThe more varied the possible differential diagnoses are, the greater the importance of the primary diagnostic instruments, namely anamnesis and clinical examination, available to the physician. The course of the illness is one of the first aspects to be considered in diagnosis: the majority of cases of*acute*lymphadenitis, which subside after 2 weeks, are of infectious origin; this contrasts with*chronic*lymph node enlargement, which is more likely to originate from neoplastic or metabolic disorders or opportunistic infections.*Subacute*lymph node enlargement has various possible causes, and additional criteria therefore need to be drawn on before determining the subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic steps (Figure 5[\\(Fig. 5\\)]()).\n### Figure 5. Algorithm of lymph node diagnosis.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n\nThe anamnesis must include any reference to a focus, including in the past, such as a sore throat, earache or toothache, insect bites or injuries. Local tenderness suggests an inflammatory component, while fever can occur equally in infections and as part of the B symptoms. Other B symptoms include night sweats (drenching) and weight loss (>10% of body weight in a period of 6 months). Positive B symptoms typically occur in malignant lymphomas (classification as A/B symptoms according to Ann Arbor), but may also accompany infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, parasitosis). The same applies to symptoms such as bone/joint pain, weakness and lowered resilience or anorexia.\n\nDetails of foreign travel and possible contact with animals (in particular cats, rabbits, rodents, tick bites) and equally of all vaccinations must also be obtained in the anamnesis. Other environmental influences and noxa (including drugs) may more rarely be the cause of lymphadenopathy, but they should nevertheless always be considered. A family anamnesis not only includes acute infections but also chronic and systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis.\n## 3 Clinical examination\n\n\nClinical examination of the young patients initially comprises inspection, palpation, ENT examination and more extensive examinations as indicated, including palpation of other lymph node regions (axillary, inguinal etc.) or of the liver and spleen.\n### Inspection\n\n\nInspection must never focus solely on the region of the lymph node itself but also extend to the drainage regions and in particular local portals of entry (tonsils, scratches or skin lesions e.g. associated with an allergic exanthema).\n### Palpation\n\n\nPalpation is similarly not restricted to the conspicuous lymph nodes and includes thorough examination of the head and neck region. It is advisable to work in a fixed order. The lymph nodes and diseases associated with them are listed in Table 2[\\(Tab. 2\\)](). One after the other, the submental and submandibular lymph nodes, the lymph nodes at the angle of the mandible, the pre- and post-auricular lymph nodes and the (sub-)occipital lymph nodes are palpated. These are followed by the group of vertical lymph nodes of the neck along the jugular vein and the posterior cervical lymph nodes along the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle and the supraclavicular lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa. Examination must also include other regions, in particular the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, liver and spleen, in order to assess systemic involvement. Palpation of the deep cervical lymph nodes is facilitated by the patient inclining their head forwards slightly to relax the strong muscles that support the head [[4]()].\n#### Table 2. Overview of lymph node regions of the neck.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n\nAccording to the AJCC Classification of cervical lymph nodes: A = Level Ia, B = Level Ib, F = Level II-IV; G = Level V; I = Level VI\n\nThe conspicuous lymph nodes are palpated for tenderness, consistency and mobility in relation to the surrounding tissue/adjacent lymph nodes. For example, swollen lymph nodes originating from an infection are generally painful, soft, fluctuant if abscessed, while nodes associated with lymphoma are typically firm, rubbery and painless, and lymph node metastases from carcinomas hard and seldom mobile [[5]()], [[6]()].\n\nIf not just a single lymph node is conspicuous and enlarged, but several – possibly also on both sides – are affected, other aspects must be taken into account for differential diagnosis. If infectious in origin, bilateral enlargement tends to suggest a viral (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus = EBV) or group A streptococcal infection (e.g. in tonsillitis), while rubella or Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) are more rarely the cause. Table 3[\\(Tab. 3\\)]()provides an overview of distribution.\n#### Table 3. Origin, localization and course of disease.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n\nA = submental, B = submandibular, C = pre-auricular, D = post-auricular, E = (sub-)occipital, F = jugular, G = posterior cervical, H = supraclavicular (s. also Table 2)\n\nThe location of the lymph node may play an additional role in securing diagnosis: in infections of the scalp, the (sub-)occipital lymph nodes are often affected and therefore require careful inspection of the skin (beneath the hair). The (sub-)occipital lymph nodes are also enlarged in toxoplasmosis, inflammation of the outer ear and rubella. Enlarged pre-auricular lymph nodes may indicate infections of the eyes (e.g. lid infections, conjunctivitis), ears, teeth or the parotid gland. Submental/submandibular lymph nodes are often conspicuous in infectious processes of the oral cavity, the nose, the maxillary sinus or the face. Lymphomas may appear practically anywhere but nevertheless often chiefly affect the lymph nodes along the jugular vein and in the occipital or supraclavicular regions. In relation to the supraclavicular lymph nodes, differential diagnosis should consider sarcoidosis and the – albeit rare – existence of lesions in the thorax and gastrointestinal tract [[6]()].\n\nThe age of the patient is a further criterion to be considered alongside location and palpation. Generally, the cause of lymph node swelling in young patients – from babies to infants and adolescents – is benign in over 80% of cases. This figure decreases considerably with age, to the extent that a malignant cause is found in over 60% of patients age 50 and above [[7]()]. However, if there is a suspicion of malignancy in a young patient, the most frequent causes in children under 6 years of age are acute leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Between the ages of 7 and 13, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma are roughly equal, with rhabdomyosarcoma and thyroid cancer occurring more rarely. From the age of 13, Hodgkin’s disease is the leading malignant cause of neck masses during childhood and adolescence [[8]()].\n\nClarifying whether a suspected malignancy exists is crucial to the further diagnostic process: a well thought-out and considerate approach to dealing with the concerned parents and the patient is essential in order to spare them any unnecessary (additional) worry while not trivializing a manifest suspicion. The doctor should assess the parents’ and patient’s need for information and be able to justify and communicate the next steps in the process. Conclusive evidence of malignancy is only possible by histological examination. In a study by Torsiglieri et. al, histological examination of 445 neck masses in children showed a malignant disease in 11% (n=48) of the cases [[9]()]. The following criteria can be used to distinguish between malignant and benign:\n\nCriteria more consistent with malignancy:\n+ \n\nover 2/2.5 cm in size\n+ \n\nfirm/hard consistency\n+ \n\nsupraclavicular/axillary localization, posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle\n+ \n\nabsence of tenderness\n+ \n\nlow mobility\n+ \n\nprogressive course\n+ \n\nB symptoms\n\nCriteria less consistent with malignancy:\n+ \n\nunder 1.5 cm in size\n+ \n\nsoft consistency\n+ \n\ntender\n+ \n\nerythema\n+ \n\nfluctuation\n+ \n\nmobility\n+ \n\nregressive course\n### Conclusion\n\n\nAnamnesis and clinical examination raise the following cardinal questions, the answers to which are instrumental in determining subsequent procedure:\n+ \n\nIs the lymph node swelling clearly pathological?\n+ \n\nHow long has the lymphadenopathy been apparent?\n+ \n\nHow old is the child?\n+ \n\nIs the course progressive, constant, regressive or intermittent?\n+ \n\nWhat is the localization?\n+ \n\nIs the lymph node swelling on one or both sides, uni- or multifocal?\n+ \n\nApart from “tumor”, are there other signs of inflammation such as “rubor”, “calor”, “dolor”, “functio laesa”?\n+ \n\nAre there any additional significant clinical findings?\n+ \n\nIs there any suspicion of malignancy?\n## 4 Further diagnosis\n\n\nIf the anamnesis and clinical examination prove inconclusive, or if confirmation of a suspected diagnosis is required, further diagnostic means are available, including serological tests, sonography as the main imaging technique, and for certain special indications also MRI and CT. As a means of obtaining histological confirmation, full dissection of a suspicious lymph node should take preference over fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), compare 4.4.\n\nClinically it is neither reasonable nor cost-effective to routinely perform every one of the available serological and microbiological tests for every patient with lymph node swelling of uncertain origin. The same is true of the imaging and histological procedures. It is therefore a question of selecting a set of diagnostic measures that best meet the individual’s clinical presentation with the highest possible sensitivity and specificity. Table 4[\\(Tab. 4\\)]()gives an overview of clinical indications from anamnesis and examination, together with the possible cause and accompanying further diagnosis in each case.\n### Table 4. Clinical parameters and steps in differential diagnosis.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n### 4.1 Laboratory\n\n\nLaboratory diagnosis is widely used in lymphadenopathy of uncertain origin. Parameters such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) are elevated in many infectious but also neoplastic and immunologic disorders and therefore tend to be nonspecific. They are nevertheless often determined in order to add a further aspect to the diagnosis.\n\nA blood count including microscopic differential hemogram can further help to confirm a suspected malignancy. Once the diagnosis has been established, the laboratory tests are used to establish which organs are involved in systemic diseases (uric acid, creatinine levels for renal involvement e.g. in SLE; GOT, GGT for liver involvement e.g. in mononucleosis; LDH and muscle enzymes e.g. in dermatomyositis) and as part of the follow-up and clinical monitoring (e.g. blood count for malignant tumors).\n### 4.2 Microbiology\n\n\nThe success of microbiological diagnosis depends to a critical degree on the quality of the material submitted for testing. If this kind of diagnosis is not performed routinely on a regular basis and there is any doubt as to the sampling procedure, it is advisable to first contact the experts for further information. How the samples are transported (temperature, culture medium, aerobic/anaerobic milieu) likewise has a decisive influence on diagnosis.\n#### Serology\n\n\nSerology is primarily used to diagnose virus-associated diseases. Pathogens such as rubella, measles, CMV and EBV are diagnosed serologically (in combination with the corresponding clinical assessment). Here it is always necessary to obtain the patient’s vaccination anamnesis.\n#### (Swab) samples\n\n\nSamples must be placed in a transport medium. The time and site of sample removal must be recorded, together with details of any antibiotic treatment already initiated. The role of swabs in cervical lymphadenitis is primarily to diagnose abscessed lymph nodes.*Staphylococcus aureus*(*S. aureus*) and*Streptococcus pyogenes*(*S. pyogenes*) are found in the majority of cases (40–80%) [[10]()], [[11]()], [[12]()], [[13]()], [[14]()]. The proportion of methicillin-resistant*S. aureus*(MRSA) bacteria in childhood ENT infections is 10–30% [[15]()], [[16]()]. In a study by Neff and colleagues, swabs were taken intraoperatively from 277 immunocompetent children and cultures set up for aerobic, anaerobic, acid-fast pathogens and fungi [[17]()]. The results showed none of the fungal cultures, 1% of the anaerobic and 2% of the acid-fast cultures to be positive. In the study, the cost of the swab cultures was put at 402 $ US dollars per patient (aerobic 94 $, anaerobic 108 $, acid-fast 100 $, fungal 96 $). MRSA pathogens were found in 38 patients (14%), 100% of which were sensitive to clindamycin. Neff and colleagues conclude that only aerobic cultures should be employed and acid-fast pathogens only cultivated if a strong clinical suspicion exists. The authors recommend empiric (single) antibiotic therapy effective against S. aureus and S. pyogenes.\n#### Blood culture and other means of pathogen detection\n\n\nBlood cultures are considerably less reliable if antibiotic treatment has already begun, since antibiotic substances continue to work in the culture bottles and may hinder pathogen growth. Full diagnosis includes cultures in an aerobic and an anaerobic medium and should be repeated at intervals of several hours to raise their diagnostic value. Blood cultures are primarily indicated in septic patients, fever of unknown origin and serious infectious diseases such as meningitis.\n\nOther means of detecting pathogens include indirect material sampling (e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL) or testing secretions (sputum, gastric juice etc.), where appropriate combined with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n#### Tuberculin skin test\n\n\nThere are various methods of tuberculin testing:\n\nThe*percutaneous test*is suitable for children under 10 years of age. It involves applying a salve containing tuberculin to the skin; the test is read after 72 hours [[18]()].\n\nIn the*Tine test*, four needles treated with tuberculin are pressed into the skin for three seconds and moved briefly. This test is also read at the earliest 72 h after administration. Both tests are approximate screening methods – the percutaneous test in particular is considered unreliable – and are therefore not recommended [[18]()].\n\nThe intracutaneous Mendel-Mantoux test is used to screen for suspected TBC by intracutaneously injecting tuberculin. The test is read after 72 hours; the induration must have a diameter of at least 6 mm to count as positive.\n\nWhat is important is that all the tuberculin tests make no distinction between an acute or past infection and only confirm exposure to the disease. The test is also positive after BCG vaccination. Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) may produce a false-positive test.\n\nAnother diagnostic test for tuberculosis is the quantiferon test. It is a serological investigation and – depending on the interferon-γ levels – evaluated as positive or negative. The advantages of the quantiferon test are its higher sensitivity (75–80%) and its independence from the vaccination status [[19]()].\n### 4.3 Imaging\n\n\nImaging is used in cervical lymph node swelling in children to confirm or eliminate a specific diagnosis (e.g. abscess) or to assess the location and number of affected structures and can significantly contribute to diagnosis where clinical assessment and anamnesis are inconclusive. Particular attention must be paid here to the age of the patients, some of whom are very young, especially in terms of their exposure to radiation, e.g. during CT, the practicability and difficulty of the procedure, and stress.\n#### Sonography\n\n\nSonography is a very valuable way of assessing lymph node swelling in children. In inflamed processes, sonography is the instrument of choice for determining localization, number, size and characteristics of the affected structures [[17]()], [[20]()], [[21]()]. In the ultrasound, inflamed lymph nodes appear enlarged and are hypoechoic compared to the adjoining connective and muscle tissue [[22]()]. Both abscess-forming lymph nodes and tuberculous lymphadenitis are characterized by central cystic changes with loss of the echogenic hilum [[23]()].\n\nSize, form, structure, intranodal necrosis, hilum structure, calcification and edema of the surrounding connective tissue are also assessed in non-infectious processes [[24]()]. Doppler sonography additionally permits imaging of the vascularization of the hilum structure and the node. Ultrasound is not only valuable in helping to identify inflammatory, abscess-forming conditions but also and above all in assessing malignant processes. Here it is important to differentiate between suspected metastases from a solid tumor and – particularly in children – manifestations of other entities, such as lymphomas.\n\nUltrasound criteria that suggest a malignant process are changes in*size and form*[[25]()]. The specificity and sensitivity here essentially depend on the defined limits [[26]()]. In general, a L/D ratio (length/depth) of <2 is seen as an indication of a malignant process [[24]()], although this is an unreliable criterion especially in the case of small lymph nodes [[27]()].\n\nThe situation is similar with the*hilum echogenity*: 84–92% of benign lymph nodes have an echogenic hilum, while the hilum structures in 76–96% of malignant lymph nodes cannot be detected on account of intranodal processes [[28]()]. It is essential to note in sonographic assessment that this is rather to be seen as a late sign and that the negative predictive value of early involvement of the lymph nodes is low [[29]()].\n\nThe*cortex configuration*of the lymph node similarly allows to draw conclusions as to the dignity of the lymph node. It is considered in relation to the hilum structure and is suspicious if the cortex diameter is greater than half the diameter of the hilum [[29]()]. A distinction must be made between concentric (bulging into the hilum) thickening of the cortex, which is considered nonspecific and may also occur in reactive changes in the lymph nodes [[29]()], and eccentric (bulging outwards) cortical thickening, which is more likely an early sign of malignancy with a high positive predictive value [[30]()].\n\nThe*internal structure*of the lymph nodes may also help to identify origin. For example, microcalcification and necrosis can be caused by infections (e.g. tuberculosis or other inflammatory granulomatous conditions) and neoplastic diseases (e.g. metastases from thyroid carcinomas). At the same time, the existence of necrosis is less consistent with lymphoma [[31]()].\n\nA valuable contribution to differential diagnosis has been made with ongoing improvements in the quality of resolution by*intranodal angiography*using Doppler sonography: neoplastic lymph nodes often exhibit pronounced hypervascularization, i.e. formation of new vessels, chiefly in the periphery of the lymph node but in some cases also beyond the lymph node capsule, which is characterized by irregular distribution and flow properties [[32]()]. In lymphatic neoplasms, the periphery is rarely affected on its own due to their intranodal origin [[33]()]. In the literature, the measurement of vascular resistance and contrast agent-supported sonographic imaging are still subjects of controversial debate in relation to sensitivity and specificity in differential diagnosis [[27]()].\n#### Computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging\n\n\nOn a CT scan, inflamed lymph nodes appear enlarged, absorb contrast agent and are oval in shape, with purulent abscesses exhibiting a ring with no contrast agent in the centre and thickening on the periphery. By contrast with tuberculous lymphadenitis, fatty deposits can often be observed in the nodes [[34]()], [[35]()]. This ring-shaped accumulation of contrast agent is often referred to in eliminating a suspected abscess, but since it is apparent in over 60% of lymphadenitis cases, it cannot be considered highly sensitive [[17]()].*Alongside exposure to radiation, this is a further reason why sonography should always be the preferred method of primary examination*[[20]()], [[21]()].\n\nA number of authors recommend computer tomography as the diagnostic instrument of choice in*deep*neck infections in order to achieve the best possible picture of the spread and origin of infection, monitor its course and help to assess the endangered mediastinal compartments [[36]()]. A CT scan provides morphological evidence to verify a suspected malignancy, primarily by size, shape and, in advanced stages, infiltration of the surrounding structures.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a further procedure available as part of more extensive diagnosis and can above all help to identify neck masses not originating in the lymph nodes. In this case – where necessary and possible – sedation is preferable to endotracheal anesthesia in children.\n### 4.4 Histological examination\n\n\nThere are two main examination techniques to obtain histological confirmation of a diagnosis: Lymph node dissection and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).\n\n*Full dissection*of the affected lymph node is considered the standard procedure of choice when it comes to obtaining histological confirmation of a diagnosis, as it permits assessment of the histopathological structures and their distribution (e.g. vascular growth beyond the capsule). It also supplies sufficient tissue for pathological and microbiological examination. This makes it possible to perform more extensive immunohistochemical staining, which is essential to differential diagnosis of lymphomas in particular, and more detailed analysis of the suspected pathogen DNA by PCR.\n\nVarying levels of sensitivity and specificity are also discussed in the literature in relation to*fine-needle biopsy*. In combination with sonography, this method produces accurate results with a high sensitivity (89–98%) and specificity (95–100%) in diagnosing malignant conditions [[37]()], [[38]()], [[39]()]. Since the negative predictive value is approx. 80%, diagnosis is incorrectly eliminated in a fifth of cases [[40]()]! This is particularly significant if only a single lymph node is affected, and FNAC causes a hemorrhagic lesion that hinders histological examination if dissection of the lymph node becomes necessary [[6]()]. In this case, the experience and expertise of the examining physician and the cytopathologist are crucial [[41]()]. Performing FNAC can be difficult anyway, particularly so in small children, and this is another consideration when deciding on procedure.\n\nA fine-needle biopsy is an option if (i) several lymph nodes are suspicious, (ii) surgical dissection is associated with a high risk that can be eliminated by FNAC, (iii) sufficient expertise is available, and (iiii) the patient is in compliance (age of the patient!).\n### Conclusion\n\n\nFurther diagnosis essentially builds on the anamnesis and clinical examination. Special laboratory tests should be conducted in particular if a specific clinical suspicion exists.*Sonography*is the first and standard choice of imaging procedure and provides answers to a range of questions in differential diagnosis. If a condition persists or malignancy is suspected,*histological examination*is warranted without too much delay, in which case the gold standard is*full dissection*of the affected lymph node.\n## 5 Causes\n\n\nThe following chapter looks at the causes of cervical lymphadenopathy, divided according to infectious, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic origin.\n### 5.1 Infectious\n\n\nIndications of lymphadenopathy of infectious origin may be specific (pathogen entry site, concurrent tonsillitis/pharyngitis) and unspecific (signs of inflammation, fever, elevated CRP, ESR). Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes in childhood, while parasites or fungal infections tend to play a less frequent role. Generalized/bilateral lymphadenitis is more consistent with viral infection, unilateral with bacterial.\n#### 5.1.1 Viral pathogens\n\n\n**Pathogenesis and etiology:**Viral infection is the most frequent cause of lymphadenitis in childhood [[42]()]. Precisely the recurring viral pathogens that are associated with infections of the upper respiratory tract (RS viruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, rhino-, adeno- and acute corona viruses) [[43]()], occur repeatedly in childhood and often cause*acute*cervical lymphadenitis. Other common viral agents, which can also cause*chronic*lymphadenitis, are the Epstein Barr virus, particularly in adolescence, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [[1]()]. Less frequently lymphadenopathy is also caused by mumps, measles, rubella, varicella, Erythema infectiosum or fifth disease, herpes simplex and Coxsackie viruses [[44]()]. HIV-associated lymphadenopathy is far less common among children than adults, but depending on the risk profile it should also be considered as a potential cause in children and especially adolescents.\n\n**Clinical presentation:**The main symptoms are defined by the infection of the upper respiratory tract: fever, pharyngitis accompanied by odynophagia, occasionally otitis/sialadenitis. These may be attended by cutaneous symptoms typical of the relevant viral infection.\n\n**Lymph nodes:**The involved lymph nodes are usually affected multiply on both sides; without erythema/fluctuation if there is no bacterial superinfection.\n\n**Diagnostics:**If a specific suspicion exists, the diagnosis may additionally include virus serology for the relevant pathogen. If viruses that also affect the spleen and liver (e.g. EBV, CMV) are suspected, an ultrasound should always be performed on the abdomen to eliminate the possibility of hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n**Therapy:**Immunocompetent patients receive supportive therapy, while prophylactic antibiotic or antiviral therapy is only indicated for immunocompromised patients or a severe clinical course [[45]()]. If the symptoms persist, reevaluation is necessary.\n#### 5.1.2 Bacterial pathogens\n\n\n**Pathogenesis and etiology:**Bacterial infections also affecting the lymph nodes can likewise be divided into acute and chronic infections. The majority (40–80%) of acute bacterial infections are caused by staphylococci and beta hemolytic serogroup A streptococci [[10]()], [[11]()], [[12]()], [[13]()], [[14]()].*Francisella tularensis*(tularemia), pasteurella,*Haemophilus influenzae*type B and anaerobic organisms such as propionibacteria, fusobacteria and peptostreptococci are more rarely the cause of cervical lymphadenopathy [[1]()]. Chronic bacterial infections of the lymph nodes are chiefly caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [[46]()], followed by other agents such as bartonella (cat-scratch disease), tuberculosis bacteria and brucella (brucellosis), cf. Table 5[\\(Tab. 5\\)]().\n##### Table 5. Overview of bacterial pathogens in cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n\n[Open in a new tab]()\n\n**Clinical symptoms:**The clinical symptoms are often comparable to an acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, accompanied by fever, odynophagia, otitis media or cough. Anaerobes may be apparent in connection with dental/gingival infections.\n\n**Lymph nodes:**The lymph nodes in acute bacterial infections are typically painful, enlarged on one side and exhibit progressive growth. The predilection sites are the submental and submandibular, jugular and occipital lymph nodes [[44]()].\n\n**Diagnostics:**Diagnosis of bacterial lymphadenitis is based on the clinical symptoms and detection of pathogens in swabs/secretion by microscope, culture or PCR, serological procedures and evidence of antigens.\n\n**Therapy:**The therapy is adapted to the relevant pathogen. The majority of acute bacterial infections are sensitive to a combination of benzylpenicillins + beta lactamase inhibitors. If empiric therapy does not lead to regression, other pathogens must be considered. In very young or immunosuppressed patients in particular, therapy may initially need to take place intravenously under inpatient supervision to avoid any serious complications.\n#### 5.1.3 Parasites/protozoa\n\n\n**Pathogenesis and etiology:**If a parasitic or protozoa-associated lymphadenopathy is suspected, an anamnesis of foreign travel and environmental factors is of primary importance. Pathogens enter the body in food (unpasteurized milk, meat, contaminated water) or through wounds and close contact with animals. The neck and throat region, as the area associated with food intake, and the draining lymph node regions are predilection sites for manifestation of the diseases.\n\n**Clinical presentation:**Parasitic infections are characterized by a deterioration in the patient’s general condition, organ involvement (toxocara (roundworm) → lungs, eyes; toxoplasmosis → eyes, ", "label": 2}, {"content": "url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32617063/\n标题: Clinical Characteristics of and Cancer Incidence in Children Evaluated for Lymphadenoapthy Referred to Pediatric Oncology Clinics.\n作者: Sema Vural,Dildar Bahar Genc,Ezgi Celikboya\n来源期刊: Sisli Etfal Hastanesi tip bulteni\n发布时间: 2020年07月04日\n内容: In our study, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and cancer frequency in patients referred to our pediatric oncology outpatient clinic for lymphadenopathy.\nThe charts of patients admitted to our pediatric oncology outpatient clinics for lymphadenopathy between January 2014, and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Age, gender, duration of complaints, previous therapies, systemic signs and symptoms, lymph node characteristics and laboratory findings were recorded. The frequency of malignancy was calculated.\nOne hundred thirty-four patients (34 girls) with a median age of six years (range four months-17 years) were included in our study. The majority of the patients (98%) had localized lymphadenopathy and the head and neck region was the most common site of involvement (87%). The median long-axis diameter of lymph nodes ranged between 0.5 cm and 5 cm (median 2 cm) by physical examination. Twenty-one patients (15.6%) had lymph node biopsy. Four patients had ruptured epidermal cyst, lymphangioma, pilomatricoma and ectopic thymus. Of the other biopsies, nine patients were diagnosed with reactive LAP, four with lymphadenitis, and four with Hodgkin's disease. The lymphoma patients had lymph node size greater than 2.5 cm and the duration of lymphadenopathy was longer than four weeks. Three out of four patients had systemic clinical findings accompanying lymph node enlargement.\nThree percent of the patients with lymphadenopathy who were referred for suspected malignancy received a cancer diagnosis. This rate, which is too low for a reference center, suggested that the patients might be referred to the pediatric oncology outpatient clinic without a thorough evaluation in primary health care.\n论文研究信息: 研究时长: between January 2014, and December 2016; 研究地点: not specified in the text, but inferred to be a country with pediatric oncology clinics; 研究方法: Observational Study; 研究目标: cancer incidence in patients with lymphadenopathy; 研究人群: patients admitted to pediatric oncology outpatient clinics for lymphadenopathy; 研究结论: 3% of the patients with lymphadenopathy who were referred for suspected malignancy received a cancer diagnosis.", "label": 0}, {"content": "url: https://guide.medlive.cn/guideline/18884\n标题: 儿童淋巴母细胞淋巴瘤诊疗规范（2019年版）\n作者: 中华人民共和国国家卫生健康委员会\n来源期刊: 中华人民共和国国家卫生健康委员会官网\n发布时间: 2019年09月05日\n文献类型: 临床实践指南\n内容: \\section*{二、适用范围}\n依据患儿临床特点, 经肿物活检、胸腹水或骨髓细胞形\n态学、免疫表型、细胞遗传学和分子生物学检测确诊, 并经至少两家三级甲等医院病理专家会诊结果一致, 按 WHO 2016 淋巴系统肿瘤病理诊断分型标准进行诊断和分型的儿童和青少年 LBL。", "label": 0}, {"content": "url: https://guide.medlive.cn/guideline/27134\n标题: 中国霍奇金淋巴瘤的诊断与治疗指南（2022年版）\n作者: 中国抗癌协会血液肿瘤专业委员会,中华医学会血液学分会(CMA,CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION),中国霍奇金淋巴瘤工作组\n来源期刊: 中华血液学杂志.2022,43(9):705-715.\n发布时间: 2022年09月30日\n文献类型: 临床实践指南\n内容: 全球数据 (GLOBOCAN 2020) 显示年全球新发 HL 共 83087 例, 其中男性 48981 例, 女性 34106 例,死亡 23376 例, 其中男性 14288 例, 女性 9088 例。而中国 2020 年新发 HL 也达 6829 例, 其中男性 4506 例, 女性 2323 例, 死亡 2807 例, 其中男性 1865 例, 女性 942 例 ${ }^{[34]}$ 。在我国, HL 占全部淋巴瘤的 $8.54 \\%{ }^{[3]}$, 男性多于女性。我国 HL 发病年龄较小, 中位发病年龄为 30 岁左右, $90 \\%$ 的 HL 以淋巴结肿大为首发症状, 以颈部淋巴结和锁骨上淋巴结常见, 然后扩散至其他淋巴结, 晚期可侵犯血管, 累及脾、肝、骨髓和消化道等。\n二、诊断、鉴别诊断、分期和预后\n(一)病理诊断\n1. 病理检查: 病理检查是确诊及分型的金标准, 推荐病变淋巴结或结外病灶切除活检, 应选择增长迅速、饱满、质韧的肿大淋巴结, 尽量完整切除; 尽量选择受炎症干扰较小部位的淋巴结; 术中应避免挤压组织, 切取的组织应尽快切开固定。除切除活检外, 不推荐细针穿刺细胞学检查, 对于纵隔或深部淋巴结可以考虑行粗针多条组织穿刺活\n检以明确病理诊断。", "label": 2}]}

Now known as the Palace Museum， it is to the north of Tiananmen Square. Rectangular in shape， it is the world‘s largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a six meter deep moat and a ten meter high wall are 9，999 buildings. The wall has a gate on each side. Opposite the Tiananmen Gate， to the north is the Gate of Devine Might (Shenwumen)， which faces Jingshan Park. The distance between these two gates is 960 meters， while the distance between the gates in the east and west walls is 750 meters. There are unique and delicately structured towers on each of the four corners of the curtain wall. These afford views over both the palace and the city outside. The Forbidden City is divided into two parts. The southern section， or the Outer Court was where the emperor exercised his supreme power over the nation. The northern section， or the Inner Court was where he lived with his royal family. Until 1924 when the last emperor of China was driven from the Inner Court， fourteen emperors of the Ming dynasty and ten emperors of the Qing dynasty had reigned here. Having been the imperial palace for some five centuries， it houses numerous rare treasures and curiosities. Listed by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site in 1987， the Palace Museum is now one of the most popular tourist attractions world wide.\n　　Construction of the palace complex began in 1407， the 5th year of the Yongle reign of the third emperor of the Ming dynasty. It was completed fourteen years later in 1420. It was said that a million workers including one hundred thousand artisans were driven into the long-term hard labor. Stone needed was quarried from Fangshan， a suburb of Beijing. It was said a well was dug every fifty meters along the road in order to pour water onto the road in winter to slide huge stones on ice into the city. Huge amounts of timber and other materials were freighted from faraway provinces. Ancient Chinese people displayed their very considerable skills in building the Forbidden City. Take the grand red city wall for example. It has an 8.6 meters wide base reducing to 6.66 meters wide at the top. The angular shape of the wall totally frustrates attempts to climb it. The bricks were made from white lime and glutinous rice while the cement is made from glutinous rice and egg whites. These incredible materials make the wall extraordinarily strong.\n　　Since yellow is the symbol of the royal family， it is the dominant color in the Forbidden City. Roofs are built with yellow glazed tiles; decorations in the palace are painted yellow; even the bricks on the ground are made yellow by a special process. However， there is one exception. Wenyuange， the royal library， has a black roof. The reason is that it was believed black represented water then and could extinguish fire.\n　　Nowadays， the Forbidde...", "label": 0}]}
